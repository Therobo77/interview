# interview
I am making this Repository for some important technical and non-technical question which an interviewer can  ask ?


## Tell me Somthing about yourself ?

-- I am a full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in coding and web development. With over 1200 hours of coding and 300 hours of practice in data structures and algorithms, I am proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and Redux.js for front-end development and Node.js for back-end development. I have also received advanced training from Masai School, a highly effective coding bootcamp focused on delivering high-quality skill development. The program included 12 hours of coding 6 days a week for 7 months and has given me a comprehensive understanding of web development best practices. In addition, I have experience with Chakra UI for styling, allowing me to deliver visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
