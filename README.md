# interview
I am making this Repository for some important technical and non-technical question which an interviewer can  ask ?


## Tell me Somthing about yourself ?

- I am a full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in coding and web development. With over 1200 hours of coding and 300 hours of practice in data structures and algorithms, I am proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and Redux.js for front-end development and Node.js for back-end development. I have also received advanced training from Masai School, a highly effective coding bootcamp focused on delivering high-quality skill development. The program included 12 hours of coding 6 days a week for 7 months and has given me a comprehensive understanding of web development best practices. In addition, I have experience with Chakra UI for styling, allowing me to deliver visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.

#### A very small indroduction (in less than 500 words)

- Experienced full-stack web developer with a background in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Redux.js, Node.js and Chakra UI. Over 1200 hours of coding and 300 hours of DSA practice with training from highly effective coding bootcamp Masai School (12 hours/week for 7 months). Skilled in delivering visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.

- Hey there, I'm Vikash Kumar Lal, a determined individual from Deoghar, Jharkhand. I started my career as a Chemistry faculty, helping 11th and 12th-grade students with their queries. However, in 2019, when my grandmother tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic, I put my career on hold and returned home to support my family.

But I didn't let this setback dampen my spirit. Despite failing to qualify for the JEE mains exam, I held onto my dream of becoming a software developer. And in 2022, I discovered Masai School, a military-style coding school that offered me the chance to learn coding from scratch. With over 1500 hours of coding, 600+ hours of DSA, and 300+ hours of soft-skill training under my belt, I completed the Masai full-stack web development course.

Outside of coding, I come from a family of five, with my father working as a farmer and my mother a homemaker. I also have two younger brothers. When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies, reading self-help books and writing Hindi poems.

I'm thrilled to re-start my career as a software developer and eager to explore new technologies to contribute to my company's growth. My unwavering determination, resilience, and passion for learning make me an asset to any organization.
